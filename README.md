## 🌟 What is polypore?

polypore is a lightweight web app to manage your film gear stock and bookings. Declare items, plan shoots, reserve equipment with availability checks, and know what's available right now.

- 📦 Stock: manage items (camera/light/cable/other), stock counts
- 🎬 Shoots: plan with name, location, start/end dates
- 🔗 Bookings: book items per shoot; prevents overbooking
