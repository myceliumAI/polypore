## 🌟 What is polypore?

polypore is a lightweight web app to manage your film gear inventory and loans. Declare items, plan shoots, reserve equipment with availability checks, and know what’s available right now.

- 🎬 Shoots: plan with name, location, start/end dates
- 📅 Reservations: reserve items per shoot; prevents overbooking
- 📊 Dashboard: see current availability per item
